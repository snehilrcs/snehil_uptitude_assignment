This repository includes a notebook for transforming a dataset of restaurants and their opening hours. The notebook reads a CSV file containing restaurant names and their opening hours, extracts the relevant timing data, and performs further computations.
To use the notebook, the user inputs the name of the CSV file and the desired date to determine which restaurants are open at that particular time on that specific day.

Directions to Use the Notebook code for results:
Step 1: Clone the repo in your local machine and open the Jupyter Notebook File.
Step 2: Enter the "date_time_object" and "csv_file_name" as the parameter to the "get_open_restaurants" and it will give the names of the restaurant open during that time at that given date.

Directions to Use the "restaurants_timing.py" file.

Step 1: Clone the repo and open the "restaurants_timing.py" file in an editor.
Step 2: Enter the data as per prometed after running the code.
Step 3: After the data is entered correctly it will provide the names of the restaurant open during that time at that given date.
